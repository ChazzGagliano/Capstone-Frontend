# Capstone-Frontend
This is the frontend portion of my Movie-App. It's in JavasScript with React as the framework. It uses axios to connect with the Ruby on Rails backend. CSS is used for styling and arrangment.


Instructions:
npm install 
npm install axios --save
npm install react-router-dom@6
npm run dev
